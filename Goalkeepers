A file to share data about goalkeepers at this Tournament.

Inspired by Simon Gleaves' work (https://twitter.com/SimonGleave).

Information about goalkeepers collected from FIFA data and is included in a csv file 

in this repository (https://github.com/2622NSW/WWCFIFA19/blob/master/G20.csv).

First file is of 20 group games.

The median height of goalkeepers in these games was 175 cms.

There are four jpg files to indicate in cms by game number and country (GK174N, GK174C, GK175N, GK175C).
