A file to share data about goalkeepers at this Tournament.

Inspired by Simon Gleave's work (https://twitter.com/SimonGleave).

Information about goalkeepers collected from FIFA data and is included in csv files (GK20.csv, GK22.csv). 

in this repository (https://github.com/2622NSW/WWCFIFA19/blob/master/G20.csv).

First file is of 20 group games. There are some goalkeeper name spelling errors in this file. They have been
corrected with reference to player profiles shared by FIFA. The file is GK22.csv

The median height of goalkeepers in these games was 175 cms.

There are four jpg files to indicate in cms by game number and country (GK174N, GK174C, GK175N, GK175C).
